# BAR CODE SCANNER PROJECT

This repository contains a barcode scanning project that combines a backend built with Django Rest Framework (DRF) and a frontend developed in Angular.

Backend: Django Rest Framework

Django Rest Framework (DRF): The backend handles HTTP requests, processes images, and manages the encoding and decoding of barcodes.
OpenCV and Pyzbar: Uses OpenCV for image capture and processing, while Pyzbar handles barcode decoding. Images are converted to base64 format for transmission and processing.
Frontend: Angular

Angular Frontend: Developed by a colleague, the frontend implements advanced logic for streaming from the camera and capturing images in real-time for barcode reading.
Real-Time Streaming and Scanning: Enables continuous video capture to detect barcodes, providing a fast and efficient scanning experience.
Features

Fast and Accurate Scanning: Utilizes advanced technologies to ensure efficient and precise barcode scanning.
Full Integration: Fully integrated backend and frontend for a complete barcode scanning solution.
User-Friendly: Simple setup on both server and client sides for quick deployment.
